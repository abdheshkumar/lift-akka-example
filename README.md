What's this??

This project was presented at the Scala LiftOff Conference 2011 in London.
It was part of my Talk [Liftweb in the Real World. A hyper-polygot's tale.](http://goodstuff.im/fbettag-liftweb-in-the-real-world-a-hyper-pol).


## How to run?

Edit src/main/resources/props/default.props and change the path to something with files (e.g. your Downloads folder). It also needs **writing permissions** on that folder in order to write the copied files into a folder called "target" (right inside the specified dir).

After that it's straight on, just run:

```
mvn jetty:run
```


## Thanks

Thanks to everybody in the Lift Community and on [Liftweb Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb).
