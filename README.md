=======

Edit src/main/resources/props/default.props and change the path to something with files (e.g. your Downloads folder). It also needs RW permissions on that folder in order to write the copied files into a folder called "target" (right inside the specified dir).

After that it's traight on, just run:

```
mvn jetty:run
```

Thanks to everybody in the Lift Community and on [Liftweb Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb).
