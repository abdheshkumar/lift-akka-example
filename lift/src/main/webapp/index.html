  <h2>Welcome to the Liftweb/Akka example project!</h2>
  <p>
    This project was presented at the Scala LiftOff Conference 2011 in London.<br/>
	It was part of my Talk <a href="http://goodstuff.im/fbettag-liftweb-in-the-real-world-a-hyper-pol">Liftweb in the Real World. A hyper-polygot's tale.</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Duplicate a file (on a remote host)</h2>
  <p>
    Choose a file that you want a backend Actor to duplicate with
	<a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html" target="_blank">rsync</a>.
	The parsed output will be "streamed" via Comet and produce a nice jQuery-UI Progressbar.
	It will only show files <strong>larger</strong> than 200MB which reside within
	the directory set as <strong>filecopy.path</strong> in .props. This works with either
	a LiftActor or an AkkaActor (both included in source).
  </p>
  <ul lift="comet?type=CopyComet" id="comet_copy_list">
    <li><a href="#">None yet</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>  </p>
  <h2>How does it all work?</h2>
  <p>
    We are combining the power of <a href="http://akka.io" target="_blank">Akka</a>
    with <a href="http://liftweb.net" target="_blank">Liftweb's</a> ability to perform
    Comet-style updates on the client's browser. None of this is
    scheduled AJAX, it's all Comet. The copy-process in the background
	uses <a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html" target="_blank">rsync</a>,
	so make sure it is in <strong>PATH</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>How to get the source?</h2>

    The full sourcecode and instructions can be found in my <a href="http://github.com/fbettag/lift-akka-example" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
