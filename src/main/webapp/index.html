  <h2>Welcome to the Liftweb/Akka example project!</h2>
  <p>
    This project was presented at the Scala LiftOff Conference 2011
    in London. The complete source code can be found
    at <a href="http://github.com/fbettag/lift-akka-example" target="_blank">my github repository</a>.

  <h2>Duplicate a file (on a remote host)</h2>
  <p>
    In this example, you can decide which file you want the
    remote-server to duplicate. It will give you feedback on how much
    has been copied through a jQuery-UI Dialog with a Progressbar
    attached to it.
  </p>
  <ul lift="comet?type=CopyComet" id="comet_copy_list">
    <li><a href="#">None yet</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does it all work?</h2>
  <p>
    We are combining the power of <a href="http://akka.io" target="_blank">Akka</a>
    with <a href="http://liftweb.net" target="_blank">Liftweb's</a> ability to perform
    Comet-style updates on the client's browser. None of this is
    scheduled AJAX, it's all Comet. The copy-process in the background
	uses <a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html" target="_blank">rsync</a>, so make sure it is in <strong>PATH</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Where to get it?</h2>
  <p>
    As already stated, please feel free to look or change the source
    code as you wish. The full source code can be found on <a href="http://github.com/fbettag/lift-akka-example" target="_blank">github</a>.
